- 👋 Hi, I’m @Juan Arias
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning non-relational databases (NoSQL) with MONGODB. In the same way, I am improving my stack in the backend with NodeJs and expanding my knowledge in the Front with React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in a web project that allows me to challenge my knowledge and thus improve my skills
